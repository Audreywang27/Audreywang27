# AuraLand

This is a funny little project I got from a wacky discussion with my friend...
Basically you make your own brainrot character!
It's meant to be annoying, so I'm sorry in advance :)
Also, no, the music can't be paused (another thing to add on to your annoyances, because brainrots are funny in a annoying way)

This is the result of my blood, sweat, and tears -- lowkey fought with this project for a super long time -- so please enjoy!

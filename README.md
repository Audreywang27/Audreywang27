This is a funny little project I got from a wacky discussion with my friend...it's called Auraland, because my original idea was "you gain aura as you stay on the site!", so I'm sorry if that's corny or anything, looking back at it it's very goofy lol

Basically my project lets you make your own brainrot character! You just toggle through the buttons, choosing what animal you want and then what accessories you want on them!

It's meant to be annoying, so I'm sorry in advance :)...I made this because I thought it would be really fun to make, and it was! I had a lot of fun showing my friends the different combinations of brainrots they could make, as well as designing the website itself!

(Also, no, the music can't be paused (another thing to add on to your annoyances, because brainrots are funny in a annoying way >:) )

I struggled quite a bit with getting the formatting correct for a long time...safe to say I learned my lesson about using position:relative...I also struggled quite a bit with formatting the clothes...lowkey gave up on the flamingo, so it looks pretty goofy, but that fits the theme of my silly project :D
Getting the background music was also a pretty big road block haha...made me crash out for like two weeks until I finally figured it out...same with getting the shoes in on the animals, since some of them have four feet and others have two...

This is the result of my blood, sweat, and tears -- lowkey fought with this project for a super long time -- so please enjoy!
